# Simple Image Encryption Tool

This project provides a simple tool for image encryption and decryption using basic pixel manipulation. The encryption algorithm inverts the pixel values of the image, and the decryption algorithm reverses this operation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL Fork)
- NumPy

You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install pillow numpy

Usage
Load the original image
Specify the path to your input image in the "input_image_path" variable.

Encrypt the image
The encryption process inverts the pixel values of the image.

Save the encrypted image
Specify the path where you want to save the encrypted image in the "encrypted_image_path" variable.

Decrypt the image
The decryption process inverts the pixel values back to their original values.

Save the decrypted image
Specify the path where you want to save the decrypted image in the "decrypted_image_path" variable.
